# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `p1_retail_db`

This project showcases essential SQL skills for data analysis by exploring, cleaning, and analyzing retail sales data. It involves setting up a database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving business insights through SQL queries. Ideal for those starting in data analytics, this project strengthens SQL proficiency while tackling real-world sales data challenges.

## Objectives

1. **Database Setup**: Create and populate a retail sales database.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand dataset trends and patterns.
4. **Business Insights**: Use SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The retail sales database `p1_retail_db` is created.
- **Table Structure**: A table `retail_sales` is defined with relevant columns.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,    
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,    
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,    
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

Key SQL queries to analyze and clean the dataset:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Insights

Example SQL queries used for analysis:

- **Total sales per category:**
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

- **Top 5 customers by total sales:**
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

- **Monthly sales trend analysis:**
```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
       AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sale
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month;
```

## Key Findings

- **Customer Insights**: Identified key demographics and spending behavior.
- **Sales Trends**: Seasonal and category-wise performance trends observed.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Patterns in large purchases revealed.

## Reports

- **Sales Summary**: Comprehensive analysis of sales data.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Understanding different buyer personas.
- **Peak Sales Analysis**: Identifying high-revenue periods.
